## Current Website Structure

### Homepage
- **Headline:** "PM who likes to code" (validated by recruiter feedback)
- **Current roles:** Stone Co + Product Heroes (both prominent)
- **Toolbox:** Prominent placement, modern stack (Cursor, Claude, Lovable, etc.)
- **Previously:** iBanFirst clearly in past
- **Education/Certs:** Well organized

### Lectures & Talks
- Masterclass with testimonials (strong social proof)
- YouTube talk embedded
- Thesis with custom PDF viewer (nice touch)
- Photo gallery of speaking events

### Projects
- **AI Localization Platform:** Strong metrics (10,000+ keys, weeks→hours, enabled expansion)
- **Bulk Payment Processor:** Clear business context (PoC that validated feature)
- **MaCarteBresil:** Appropriately labeled as personal project

---

## What's Working Well

1. **Clear hierarchy:** Current roles → Toolbox → Previously → Education
2. **Metrics on projects:** "10,000+ keys", "weeks to hours", "enabled expansion to Poland and Greece"
3. **Social proof:** Student testimonials with names and companies
4. **Honest framing:** Personal project clearly labeled, not oversold
5. **Technical credibility:** Toolbox shows modern AI-native stack
6. **Teaching validates "PM who codes":** You're not just claiming it, you're teaching it

---

## Remaining Gaps

### 1. Metrics (High Priority)
No metrics on roles — this is the #1 gap. Projects have metrics, but job roles don't.

**iBanFirst (salvage attempt):**
- Check old Slack, PRDs, quarterly reports
- Ask former colleagues
- Even directional metrics help ("improved X by ~Y%")

**Stone (track going forward):**
- Screenshot dashboards monthly
- Save key numbers in a note: "Jan 2026: X users, Y transactions"
- When you ship, write one line with before/after

### 2. No GitHub Link (Medium Priority)
You teach people to build. Having a public repo would strengthen credibility.

**Options:**
- Link to AutoTranslator repo (if public)
- Create a small utility and publish it
- Even a gist collection would help

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Your Differentiators
| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Technical PM who teaches | Product Heroes instructor |
| Fintech depth (Brazil + EU) | Stone, iBanFirst |
| AI-native builder | Teaching AI tools, modern stack |
| International profile | 4 countries, 4 languages |

### Target Roles
- Senior/Staff PM at fintechs (Nubank, Mercado Pago, Wise)
- Technical PM at AI companies
- PM Lead/Manager at growth-stage startups

---

## Final Assessment

**Grade: A-**

The website now tells the right story:
> "Technical PM at a major Brazilian fintech, teaching AI development to Italy's PM community, with hands-on projects that show real business impact."

**To reach A/A+:**
- Add metrics to roles (highest impact)
- Add GitHub presence
- Consider 1-2 blog posts on AI + PM topics

**Bottom line:** The website is now an asset, not a liability. A recruiter visiting vinicius.pm sees exactly what they should: a technical PM with fintech expertise and teaching credentials.
